Earth and Planetary Science (EPS),109,Computer Simulations in Earth and Planetary Sciences,MATH 1A,4,COMSOL,"Introduction to modern computer simulation methods and their application to selected Earth and Planetary Science problems. In hands-on computer labs, students will learn about numerical algorithms, learn to program and modify provided programs, and display the solution graphically. This is an introductory course and no programming experience is required. Examples include fractals in geophysics, properties of materials at high pressure, celestial mechanics, and diffusion processes in the Earth. Topics range from ordinary and partial differential equations to molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.",Physical Science
Earth and Planetary Science (EPS),104,Mathematical Methods in Geophysics,"MATH 53, MATH 54",4,MATLAB,"Linear systems. Linear inverse problems, least squares; generalized inverse, resolution; Fourier series, integral transforms; time series analysis, spherical harmonics; partial differntial equations of geophysics; functions of a complex variable; probability and significance tests, maximum likelihood methods. Intended for students in geophysics and other physical sciences.",Physical Science
Physics (PHYSICS),77,Introduction to Computational Techniques in Physics,"MATH 1A, PHYS 7A",2,nan,"Introductory scientific programming in Python with examples from physics. Topics include: visualization, statistics and probability, regression, numerical integration, simulation, data modeling, function approximation, and algebraic systems. Recommended for freshman physics majors. ",Physical Science
