We will also consider scholarly debates over quantitative evidence and historical argument.",Humanities
Mass Communications (MASSCOM),130,Research Methods in Media Studies,MASSCOM 10,4,nan,"This course is intended to familiarize students with some of the primary research methods used to study mass media texts and audiences (and the relationship between the two). Because the field of media studies has historical roots in both the social sciences and humanities, the course will cover both quantitative and qualitative approaches to communications research. Course readings will describe research methods, offer examples of research projects and findings, and present critiques of research studies and methods. ",Humanities
Media Studies (MEDIAST),130,Research Methods in Media Studies,MASSCOM 10,4,nan,"This course is intended to familiarize students with some of the primary research methods used to study mass media texts and audiences (and the relationship between the two). Because the field of media studies has historical roots in both the social sciences and humanities, the course will cover both quantitative and qualitative approaches to communications research. Course readings will describe research methods, offer examples of research projects and findings, and present critiques of research studies and methods. Course assignments will involve designing and conducting a series of sample projects on a single topic of the student's choosing in order to gain a fuller understanding of various research methods and their limitations and strengths. There are five separate research projects on the syllabus; students must complete the first project and may conduct any three of the remaining four projects. Students must present and discuss their research findings for one project to the class.",Humanities
