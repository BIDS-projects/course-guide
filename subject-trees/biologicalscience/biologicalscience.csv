"Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)",88B,Data Sciences in Ecology and the Environment,DATA 8,2,nan,"Many of the greatest challenges we face today come from understanding and interacting with the natural world: from global climate change to the sudden collapse of fisheries and forests, from the spread of disease and invasive species to the unknown wealth of medical, cultural, and technological value we derive from nature. Advances in satellites and micro-sensors, computation, informatics and the Internet have made available unprecedented amounts of data about the natural world, and with it, new challenges of sifting, processing and synthesizing large and diverse sources of information. In this course, students will apply methods and understanding they gain in the Foundations course to real-world ecological and environmental data sets. Through this hands-on approach, students will learn more about issues in the natural world while also developing the practical skills for working with heterogeneous real-world data encountered in all areas of data science.",Biological Science
"Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)",88A,Exploring Geospatial Data,DATA 8,2,nan,"From interactive web maps to spatial data analysis, digital geographic data and information are becoming an important part of the data science landscape. Almost everything happens somewhere that can be mapped on the surface of the earth. In many cases the where matters as much to an analysis as the what and the why. Geospatial data analysis allows a researcher to consider location explicitly. This course provides an introduction to working with digital geographic data, or geospatial data. We will explore concepts of geospatial data representation, methods for acquisition, processing and analysis, and techniques for creating compelling geovisualizations. No prior knowledge is assumed or expected.",Biological Science
"Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)",C177,GIS and Environmental Spatial Data Analysis,None,4,nan,"This course offers an introduction to spatial data analysis. It integrates ArcGIS analysis with spatial statistical analysis for the study of pattern and process applicable to a wide variety of fields. Major topics covered include: spatial sampling, processing data with ARC Info, exploratory GIS analysis, spatial decomposition, spatial point patterns and Ripley's K function, spatial autocorrelation, geostatistics, spatially weighted regression, spatial autoregression, generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models.",Biological Science
Geography (GEOG),187,Geographic Information Analysis,None,4,nan,"A spatial analytic approach to digital mapping and GIS. Given that recording the geolocation of scientific, business and social data is now routine, the question of what we can learn from the spatial aspect of data arises. This class looks at challenges in analyzing spatial data, particularly scale and spatial dependence. Various methods are considered such as hotspot detection, interpolation, and map overlay. The emphasis throughout is hands on and practical rather than theoretical.",Biological Science
